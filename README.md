## Why?

Industrial CT software is powerful — but heavy.

Sometimes you just need to:

- Check what a volume contains  
- Verify the correct scan revision  
- Quickly inspect for obvious porosity or defects  
- Share a fast visual reference  

Without waiting for full inspection software to boot.

This viewer is built for that exact moment.

It is intentionally scoped as a **quick inspection tool**, not a full analysis suite.

## What It Is

A lightweight WebGL-based 3D volume renderer that runs entirely in the browser.

- No installation  
- No plugins  
- Works on laptops and tablets  
- Optimized for fast first render  
- Streaming enabled for large volumes

Built specifically for **industrial inspection workflows**.
